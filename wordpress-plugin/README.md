# Vinco MAM WordPress Plugin

WordPress plugin that provides the admin interface for Vinco Media Asset Management.

## Installation

1. Copy this directory to `wp-content/plugins/vinco-mam`
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress admin
3. Configure settings in Vinco MAM > Settings

## Building the React Admin UI

The React admin UI must be built before the plugin will work:

```bash
cd ../admin-ui
npm install
npm run build
```

This will output compiled files to `assets/build/` which the plugin will enqueue.

## Structure

- `vinco-mam.php` - Main plugin file
- `includes/` - PHP classes (Core, API, Auth, Settings, Roles)
- `admin/` - Admin interface classes
- `assets/build/` - Compiled React application (generated by build process)
- `languages/` - Translation files (i18n)

## Development

1. Make changes to PHP files
2. Make changes to React UI in `admin-ui/` directory
3. Run `npm run build` in `admin-ui/` to compile
4. Test in WordPress admin

## API Proxy

The plugin acts as a proxy between WordPress and AWS API Gateway:
- Authenticates WordPress users
- Generates JWT tokens for AWS
- Proxies API requests
- Handles WordPress capabilities/permissions
